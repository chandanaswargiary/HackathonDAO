# HackathonReward Smart Contract

## Project Description

The HackathonReward smart contract is a Solidity-based contract designed to manage the registration of participants in a hackathon and distribute rewards to them. The contract allows an admin to register participants and distribute rewards, while ensuring that each participant can only claim their reward once. It also provides functionality for the admin to withdraw funds from the contract.

## Key Features

- **Admin Control**: Only the admin (the contract deployer) can register participants and withdraw funds.
- **Participant Registration**: Admin can register participants by adding their addresses to the list.
- **Reward Distribution**: Registered participants can claim rewards if they haven't already done so and if the contract balance is sufficient.
- **Event Logging**: The contract emits events for participant registration and reward distribution to provide transparency and track contract activity.
- **Fund Management**: Admin can withdraw Ether from the contract balance.

## Project Vision

The HackathonReward smart contract aims to streamline the process of rewarding participants in a hackathon setting. By automating participant registration and reward distribution, the contract reduces administrative overhead and ensures fairness by preventing duplicate claims. The vision is to create a secure and transparent system for managing rewards in competitive and collaborative environments, leveraging blockchain technology to simplify and trustlessly handle reward processes.

Feel free to explore the contract and consider how it can be adapted for various incentive-based scenarios!
